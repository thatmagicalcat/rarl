# RARL
Rust Animation Rendering Library, pronounced as "ral", is a library for rendering 2D animations in Rust. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while also being powerful and flexible. 

The library is built on top of the [cairographics](https://cairographics.org) for rendering vector graphics, [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for video encoding and [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) for typesetting.
